### Customization

You can customize the chatbot example according to your specific requirements. Here are a few areas you can modify:

- **Product Prices**: In the `getProductPrice()` function in the `script.js` file, you can replace the placeholder product prices with your own logic to retrieve prices from a database or API. Update the `prices` object with the appropriate product names and their corresponding prices.

- **Styling**: The appearance of the chatbot interface can be customized by modifying the CSS rules in the `style.css` file. Feel free to adjust the colors, fonts, sizes, or layout to match your desired design.

- **Behavior**: The chatbot's behavior can be modified by editing the JavaScript code in the `script.js` file. You can extend the functionality to handle additional user inputs, add error handling, integrate with external APIs, or introduce more complex conversational logic.
